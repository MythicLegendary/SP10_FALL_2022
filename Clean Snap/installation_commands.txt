npm install @metamask/snap-types
npm install @metamask/detect-provider
npm install ethers
npm install web3

after installing web3, errors happened.

reinstalled ethers
reinstalled @metamask/detect-provider

All of these installations should be performed at the "Clean Snap" directory.

Additionally, a conflict exists created by the actual MetaMask snap template creators. In order to get around it, we need to ensure that the snap-types module
that we're importing is the correct one. To do so, manually set the "import" statment on line 1 of index.ts to the path in your directory leading to
@metamask/snap-types inside of Clean Snap/node_modules.

Note that ethers is a little busted since they changed how all of the import setup works recently. Will need to find
an intuitive way to chec isUnlocked easily. Ask Professor about it this week! (2/8/2023)
