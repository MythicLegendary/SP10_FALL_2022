npm install @metamask/snap-types

after installing web3, errors happened.

reinstalled ethers
reinstalled @metamask/detect-provider

All of these installations should be performed at the "Clean Snap" directory.

Additionally, a conflict exists created by the actual MetaMask snap template creators. In order to get around it, we need to ensure that the snap-types module
that we're importing is the correct one. To do so, manually set the "import" statment on line 1 of index.ts to the path in your directory leading to
@metamask/snap-types inside of Clean Snap/node_modules.
